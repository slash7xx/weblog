<h2> What IS CRISPR? </h2>
<p>CRISPR is an incrediibly useful genetic editing technology that's used for a multitude of reasons. But what is it? well, to start us off, RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is like a tiny, less permanent DNA. It comes in strands, not double helixes and a strand has to be created to locate the gene that needs to be edited. It's incredibly necessary that the RNA is identical to whatever gene you're trying to find as none of the steps after this will work. Next, an enzyme called Cas9 merges with the RNA to create the RNP complex, which is what does all the fun stuff. The Cas9 then "cuts" the DNA into two strands, and after that you can cut, delete, or replace DNA.</p>

<h3>Some genetic diseases that affect all ages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cancer</li>
  <li>Cystic fibrosis</li>
  <li>Down Syndrome</li>
  <li>Turners Syndrome</li>
  <li>Sickle Cell</li>
  <li>Klinefelter Syndrome</li>
</ul>


<h2>-CRISPR's Good Uses</h2>

<p>Many children (I say children because most die before adulthood) die of genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis or Tay - Sachs that (by present methods) are essentially uncureable. While technologies have been created to make life better, that's not what I'm talking about. You can learn more about <strong>that</strong> <a href="https://www.cff.org/managing-cf/understanding-changes-life-expectancy">here</a>.CRISPR technologies can help immensely with these diseases with editing these mutated, messed up genes into ones that fit their original purposes. A link can be found below with current data of mortality rates of cystic fibrosis. Delivery can range, from bacteriophagi (bacteria that reproduce by injecting cells with D.N.A.) and direct injection. Additionally, CRISPR could one day be used to alter our own DNA for higher intelligence or to be better suited to other planets.</p>

<h2>-CRISPR's... Really bad uses.</h2>

<p>With every invention, regardless of intention, comes evil, and this is no different. Chemical warfare becomes spreading pandemics to other countries that kill quickly and quietly, even with the Geneva Convention. Or even super soldiers! One day the dystopian young adult books (which are not even one tenth as cruel as the real world would be if this was used for evil) might become a reality. This can be prevented with better laws, however, and increased awareness.</p>

<h2>-CRISPR's Future</h2>

<p>CRISPR is a technology that's still in it's earlier stages, and is relatively expensive. but one day these great things can be a reality, and the bad ones... hopefully not. but with help, CRISPR can become CRISPIER  AND  less expensive. And that's a future I'd like to live in.</p>
